To convert the provided WebLogic-based Java code into a modern Spring Boot application, we will follow the requirements outlined in your request. The original code is a JMX bean implementation that uses Java EE's `StandardMBean`. In Spring Boot, we can replace this with a Spring-managed bean and use Spring's capabilities for managing application state.

Here’s how we can refactor the `AnvilInvokeBeanImpl` class into a Spring Boot component:

### Refactored Code


package com.acme.anvil.management;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.extern.slf4j.Slf4j;

@Slf4j
@Service
public class AnvilInvokeService {

    @Getter
    private int invoked = 0;

    /**
     * Increments the invoked count.
     */
    public void addInvoked() {
        invoked++;
        log.info("Invoked count incremented to: {}", invoked);
    }
}


### Key Changes Explained

1. **Class Annotations**:
   - Replaced `StandardMBean` with `@Service` to indicate that this class is a Spring service component. This allows Spring to manage the lifecycle of the bean.
   - Added `@Slf4j` for logging, which provides a logger instance for the class.

2. **State Management**:
   - The `invoked` variable is now managed directly within the service class. We use the `@Getter` annotation from Lombok to generate a getter method for the `invoked` variable, simplifying the code.

3. **Logging**:
   - Added logging in the `addInvoked` method to track when the count is incremented. This is a modern approach to logging in Spring applications.

4. **Removed JMX**:
   - The JMX-related functionality is removed since Spring Boot does not require JMX for this use case. If JMX exposure is needed, Spring Boot provides support for JMX through its configuration, but it is not included in this refactor as it was not part of the original requirement.

### Additional Considerations

- **Configuration**: If you need to expose this service via JMX, you can configure it in your Spring Boot application properties or use Spring's JMX support.
  
- **Testing**: Ensure that you write unit tests for the `AnvilInvokeService` to verify that the `addInvoked` method correctly increments the `invoked` count.

- **Dependency Management**: Make sure to include the necessary dependencies in your `pom.xml` for Spring Boot, Lombok, and any other required libraries.

### Example `pom.xml` Dependencies

Here’s an example of what your `pom.xml` might include for Spring Boot:

xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
        <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
        <optional>true</optional>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <!-- Other dependencies as needed -->
</dependencies>


### Conclusion

This refactor maintains the original logic of counting invocations while adapting it to a Spring Boot context. The use of Spring's dependency injection and logging capabilities enhances the maintainability and clarity of the code. If you have additional components or services that need to be migrated, similar principles can be applied.
